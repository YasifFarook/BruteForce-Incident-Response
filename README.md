# BruteForce-Incident-Response

🛡 Brute-Force Attack Incident Response & Security Audit

Overview

This project simulates a brute-force attack on an SSH service, followed by an in-depth security investigation using Splunk SIEM. The goal is to evaluate system resilience, detect security weaknesses, and implement remediation strategies based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

🔍 Project Objectives

Simulate a brute-force attack on SSH using Hydra.

Investigate security logs with Splunk SIEM to analyse authentication failures.

Apply security improvements, such as firewall rules and SSH hardening.

Develop a structured incident response playbook for security teams.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Kali Linux 2024.4 (Attack Simulation)

- Hydra (Brute-force attack tool)

- Nmap (Network scanning & enumeration)

- Splunk SIEM (Security log analysis & visualization)

- Linux SSH Service (Targeted system component)

🚀 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Attack Simulation

 * Used Hydra to execute a brute-force attack on SSH authentication.

 * Monitored real-time logs to detect unauthorized login attempts.

2️⃣ Log Analysis with Splunk

Collected and ingested log data into Splunk SIEM.

 * Filtered logs to identify failed login attempts and security gaps.

 * Created Splunk dashboards to visualize brute-force attack patterns.

3️⃣ Security Enhancements & Remediation

 * Applied firewall rules to restrict SSH access.

 * Implemented failed login attempt rate limiting.

 * Enforced stronger authentication policies and logging improvements.

📊 Key Findings

 * Brute-force attack successfully cracked an SSH password on attempt #500.

 * No real-time alerts were triggered, exposing logging deficiencies.

 * Lack of automated SIEM alerting allowed prolonged unauthorized access attempts.
